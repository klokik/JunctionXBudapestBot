I’d like to give you an overview of what I’ve been doing for the last 5 years.  

So I’m going to start in {start_year}, where I was working at {work-place-1}.
So I’m going to start in {start_year}, where I was studying at {EDU-organisation-1}. 

While I was at {EDU-organisation-1} I also worked as a {title-1}.
While I was at {work-place-1} I also studied {edu1-subject-1}.

I stayed at {work-place-1} for roughly {work-place1-years}. 
I stayed at {EDU-organisation-1} for roughly {EDU-organisation-1-years}.

I am currently still at {EDU-organisation-C}.
I am currently still at {work-place-1}.

{work-place-1} was a valuable experience because I definitely improved my knowledge of {work-subject-1}. 
{EDU-organisation-C} was a valuable experience because I definitely improved my knowledge of {edu1-subject-1}.

At {work-place-1} I was writing in {language-1}, and {language-2}.
At {EDU-organisation-C} I was writing in {language-1}, and {language-2}.

I would say {soft-skill-1}, {soft-skill-2}, and {soft-skill-3} were among the skills I utilised the most 

{work-place-1} has been a valuable experience because I’m definitely improving my knowledge of {subject-1}.
{EDU-organisation-1} has been a valuable experience because I’m definitely improving my knowledge of {subject-1}.

At {work-place-1} I’ve also been writing in {language-1}, and {language-2}.
At {EDU-organisation-C} I’ve also been writing in {language-1}, and {language-2}.

I would say {soft-skill-1}, {soft-skill-2}, and {soft-skill-3} are among the skills I’m using the most 

I think over the last few years I’ve really found that {skill-1} is definitely one of my strongest, followed by {skill-2}.
